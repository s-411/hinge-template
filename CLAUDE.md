## How to work in this repo

1. **Run `BOOTSTRAP.md` first** if this is your first session in this repo, or if anything seems off (missing skills, build errors, missing files). It's a 5-minute verification that catches problems before they cascade.
2. **Read `PROCESS_GUIDE.md`.** It defines all 16 stages with skip conditions.
3. **Find the current stage above.** Do only that stage's work. Do not get ahead.
4. **Use the prompt from `PROMPTS.md`** for the current stage.
5. **Self-check after every phase.** Invoke `/skill self-check` before claiming any phase done.
6. **Park scope creep in `LATER.md`.** Never expand scope inside the current stage.
7. **Read context first. Plan mode before building.** No code without a plan I've approved.

## Hard constraints

- **No inline hex colors.** Every color comes from `src/theme/theme.ts` via import.
- **No magic spacing values.** Every spacing comes from `theme.ts` spacing scale (`4/8/12/16/24/32/48`).
- **No inline font families.** Every font comes from `theme.ts`.
- **For Local profile:** no real auth, no real backend, no real payments in v1.
- **For Convex profile:** Convex DB IS the v1 backend. Real payments still parked in `LATER.md`. Auth via @convex-dev/auth — anonymous by default, accounts when needed. See `convex-auth-setup.md`.
- **One agent per repo at a time.** If another agent is already working here, stop.
- **Global keyboard dismiss button required.** A `KeyboardHideButton` component must be mounted once at the app root (after the navigator). Appears above any keyboard/number pad, right-aligned, themed to match the app. One mount covers every screen — do not add per-screen.

## When in doubt

Stop. Ask. Don't guess. The cost of asking is 30 seconds; the cost of guessing wrong is undoing 2 hours of work.
